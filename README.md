Assignment Environment:
1. This application populates and provides retrieval features for transactions of a company.
2. Transaction information is coming as files (letâ€™s say every 5 minutes) in a folder.
3. Another folder contains a file, which contains reference data for products, against which the
transactions are happening.

reload the already available data in the transaction folder upon start-up of the application.

  a. transactionId
  b. productId
  c. transactionAmount d. transactionDatetime

folders.
